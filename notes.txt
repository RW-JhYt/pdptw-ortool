Data:
- vehicle based travel time estimates (done)

Constraints:
- max pickup distance
    - hard limit (done)
    - soft limit with penalty (done)

- job - driver eligibility constraint (Consider using 'routing.SetAllowedVehiclesForIndex')
    - vehicle type requirements
    - alcohol policy

- pooling constraints:
    - max jobs
    - max delivery distance
    - job pooling eligibility

Objectives with non-linear penalty schemes:
- pickup/delivery delay
- pickup distance
- pickup duration
- fib time


Issues:
- Fix the driver start and end locations and time windows. (Done)
    - Does the current implementation of dummy pickup and delivery nodes ensure this?
    - Maybe there is a way to specify the start and end locations
